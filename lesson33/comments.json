        "3": "I dont agree with treating male/female friendships any differently than male/male friendships. He invites you to the bar when a group of people are hanging out, that's normal. It would be awkward for you to be invited to a one-on-one hangout with any friend. I dont think it's an issue. \n\nAnd I dont think it's fair that you say no girls on this trip. Hes not a teenager. If you think a girl being there will mean he will cheat, you shouldn't be in a relationship. I come at this with the perspective of a bisexual person dating a bisexual person. If we cant hang out solo with genders we are attracted to, we would never be able to hang out with anybody. I think the idea of this is silly and perpetuates unhealthy gender roles and division. So I think you have a bad mindset about women and men.\n\nBUT with all that said, there are totally problems here and I dont think you're imagining it all. My take would be way different if he hasn't cheated in the past, but well... he has. That's a huge red flag painting this whole situation. Also can we talk about how he still hangs out and likes someone who SEXUALLY ASSAULTED his wife?? Holy shit. That is terrible. And then the deleted messages. That's super weird. \n\nSo I guess I'm not totally sure what my advice is. I think if theres not trust in a relationship, it needs to end. If you cant trust your partner around an entire half of the population, something is broken. You could just ask him straight up. Clear communication is key. I dont know if you would seem like a crazy wife to reach out to the coworker. Maybe you could do couples therapy? I wish I had better advice but I at least hope an outsider's reaction to the situation will help you work through your thoughts.",

The prep phase or the action phase. Personally, I'd want to go to the action phase because it would be interesting to see how the player adapts to a situation. You could have the player be watching the security cameras. Have there be choices for the player to make during the action phase such as, how many of my guards from which area do I want to investigate the suspicious crash noise? Would this leave other area vulnerable? How should I react to the rc cameras that the infiltrator released? Should I implement an high powered security measure (heart beat sensor with small radius possibly) even if it has a high cool down? What in the facility is the infiltrator's target? I believe this approach would be a cool way of making someone feel like they are in the shoes of a high stakes security officer.",
